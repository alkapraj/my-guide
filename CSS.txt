A table is divided into ROWS, and each row contains one or more cells. Cells are children of ROWS, they are NEVER children of columns.

"display: table-column" does NOT provide a mechanism for making columnar layouts (e.g. newspaper pages with multiple columns, where content can flow from one column to the next).

Rather, "table-column" ONLY sets attributes that apply to corresponding cells within the rows of a table. E.g. "The background color of the first cell in each row is green" can be described.

The table itself is always structured the same way it is in HTML.

<table ..>
  <col .. />
  <col .. />
  <tr ..>
    <td ..></td>
    <td ..></td>
  </tr>
  <tr ..>
    <td ..></td>
    <td ..></td>
  </tr>
